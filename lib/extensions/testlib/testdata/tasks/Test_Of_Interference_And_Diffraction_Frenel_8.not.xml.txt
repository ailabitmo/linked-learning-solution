    path of the ray d2, that results in biasing of the central band
    to the position initially taken by the 5th light interference <LU LEMMA="interference" CAT="N" FLX="NEUTER_E" Case="loc" Nb="sg">interference</LU>
    band. Radiating wavelength is 600 nm, plane refractive index n <LU LEMMA="wavelength" CAT="N" FLX="NEUTER_E" Case="loc" Nb="sg">Wavelength</LU>
    = 1,5. What is the thickness of the plane?  8,4 7,2 6,0 4,8 3,6 No right answer.
