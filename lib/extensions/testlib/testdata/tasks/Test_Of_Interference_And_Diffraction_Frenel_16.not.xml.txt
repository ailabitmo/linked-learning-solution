    from the point monochromatic source throwing light to the plane
    parallel glass. How a) increase of d; b) decrease of d will
    influence the number of the ring in point A?  No right answer. Ð°) will descrease; b) will
      increase. Ð°) will increase; b) will
      descrease. Diameters of the rings do not depend on d
      and n. Both cases result in decrease of
      N. Both cases result in increase of
      N.
