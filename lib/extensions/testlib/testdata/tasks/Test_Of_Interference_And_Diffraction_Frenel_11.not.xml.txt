    opaque disk D. A light spot (Poisson spot) is observed on the
    screen P in the centre of the geometric shadow. Select all true
    statements about this spot.  The spot appears only when the disc
      overlaps an odd number of Fresnel zones. The spot appears only when the disc
      overlaps an even number of Fresnel zones. The spot appears only when the disc
      overlaps any number of Fresnel zones. If D increases, the spot becomes more
      narrow and hueless. If L decreases, the spot becomes more
      narrow and hueless.
