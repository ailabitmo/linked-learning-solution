 <img src="http://open.ifmo.ru/images/a/a8/2270431_int072p.gif"/> An interference pattern is observed in the reflected
    light in the following system: a convexo-plane lens (n1 = 1.69)
    is enclosed into a concave-plane lens (n2 = 1.63), the space
    between them is filled with benzene. Mark the number of the
    right condition for emerging of dark rings. The left part of
    the formula should contain expression for the optical path
    difference of the interfering rays.  1 2 3 4 5 No right answer. There is no right expression.
