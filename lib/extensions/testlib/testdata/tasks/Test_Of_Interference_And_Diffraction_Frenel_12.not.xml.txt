    point source S and a point of observance P. Amplitude in P
    corresponds to the vector AB1 if the radius of the aperture is
    R. If the amplitude now corresponds to the vector AB2, what is
    the change of R?  No right answer. R decreased by 1.29 times. R increased by 1.29 times. R increased by 1.67 times. R decreased by 1.73 times. R increased by 1.73 times.
