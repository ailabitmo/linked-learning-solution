    filled by liquid having minor refractive index in respect to
    the glass refractive index?  No right answer. Radiuses of the rings will
      decrease. The interference pattern remains. The interference pattern will become
      inverse. Radiuses of the rings will
      increase. The will be no interference
      pattern.
