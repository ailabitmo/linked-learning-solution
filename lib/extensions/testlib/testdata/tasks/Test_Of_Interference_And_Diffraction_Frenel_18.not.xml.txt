 <img src="http://open.ifmo.ru/images/7/79/2268861_dif32.gif"/> A plane monochromatic lightwave (distance a is large,
    Î» = 400 nm) having intensity J0 falls normally on the round
    aperture with diameter D = 2.0 mm. The interference pattern is
    on the screen placed at the distance b = 2 m. One of the
    vectors shown on the vector diagram is corresponding to the
    amplitude in P (the centre of the screen). Mark the number of
    the vector, corresponding to a given aperture.  1 2 3 4 5 No right answer.
